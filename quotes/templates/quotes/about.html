    <h1>About Friedrich Nietzsche</h1>
    <p>
    Friedrich Nietzsche (1844–1900) was a German philosopher, cultural critic, and poet.  
    He is best known for his works: <em>Thus Spoke Zarathustra</em>,  
    <em>Beyond Good and Evil</em>, and <em>The Birth of Tragedy</em>. Nietzsche challenged traditional  
    morality, religion, and the foundations of Western philosophy, introducing influential ideas like  
    the <strong>Übermensch</strong>, the <strong>will to power</strong>, and the declaration that  
    "God is dead."

  <p>
    My name is Song Yu Chen and I am a senior studying Computer Science at Boston University.
    I created this project as part of a Django learning exercise.  
    It demonstrates how to build a dynamic web app with quotes, images, and styled templates.  
    The app’s goal is to provide an engaging way to explore Nietzsche’s philosophical insights through some of his famous quotes.
